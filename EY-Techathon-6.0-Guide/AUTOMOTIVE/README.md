## 🧾 Problem Statement

A leading automotive OEM and service network in India provides aftersales maintenance services to a large customer base across metros and tier-2 cities. The business aims to increase customer retention, reduce vehicle breakdowns, optimize service center utilization, and improve manufacturing quality by proactively predicting maintenance needs, autonomously scheduling service appointments, and feeding insights back to the manufacturing team.

To achieve this, the company plans to deploy a web-based Agentic AI system acting as a Master Agent orchestrating multiple Worker AI agents to handle end-to-end predictive maintenance, customer engagement, service scheduling, and manufacturing quality improvement—using real-time vehicle data, historical maintenance logs, and CAPA/RCA records.
