## 🧾 Problem Statement 

The project focuses on automating the B2B RFP response process for a large industrial products manufacturer operating across FMCG, wires, and cables. The objective is to increase the number of RFP qualifications and responses while reducing bottlenecks in the process.

The current workflow is entirely manual:

- Sales Team manually identifies RFPs from various sources.
- Technical Team matches RFP requirements with OEM product SKUs.
- Pricing Team estimates product prices and additional testing costs.
- Sales Team consolidates inputs and submits the RFP response.

This project uses an **Agentic AI approach** to orchestrate multiple agents:

- **Sales Agent** identifies RFPs due in the next three months and summarizes requirements.
- **Technical Agent** maps RFP product requirements to the closest OEM SKUs.
- **Pricing Agent** assigns unit prices and test costs based on predefined tables.
- **Master Agent** consolidates outputs and produces the final RFP response.

The goal is to automate end-to-end RFP processing and improve the timeliness and quality of submissions.
